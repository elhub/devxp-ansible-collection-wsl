# OCI CLI

This role installs OCI CLI.
The implementation is based on:

* the [manual installtion guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/climanualinst.htm#Manual_Installation)
* what the [automatic installer](https://github.com/oracle/oci-cli/blob/master/scripts/install/install.py) actually does
